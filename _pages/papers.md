**The Ripple Effects of Parental Retirement on Adult Children Well Being: evidence from the UK** (with Andrew Clark). 2023. <br/>

<div id="retirement" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper explores the causal impact of parental retirement on adult children's well-being, an area primarily overlooked in current literature. As societies age and retirement rates increase, policymakers concerned with the financial sustainability of pension systems must comprehend these ripple effects. We establish a causal relationship between parental retirement and adult-child well-being and provide evidence for mechanisms that pertain to inter-generational time and financial transfers. We employ two identification strategies: a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design based on the eligibility age for the State Pension and a Differences-in-Difference design based on the provisions of the UK 1995 and UK 2011 Pension Acts. We draw data from the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society to follow parents and children up to and after retirement. The findings offer fresh evidence on the societal consequences of policies targeting retirement age.

**Predicting depression in old age: combining life-course data with machine learning** (with Alessio Fusco, Philippe Van Kerm, and Stephane Bordas). 2023. <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('log0')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][log0-draft] ] </small>

Depression in old age has negative individual and societal consequences. With ageing populations, understanding life course factors that raise the risk of clinical depression in old age may reduce healthcare costs and guide resources allocation. In this paper, we estimate the risk of self-reported depression by combining adult life course trajectories and childhood conditions in supervised machine learning algorithms. Our contribution is threefold. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we first implement and compare the performance of six alternative machine learning algorithms. Second, we analyse the performance of the algorithms using different life-course data configurations. While we obtain similar predictive abilities between algorithms, we achieve the highest models' performance when employing high-dimensional and less structured data. Finally, we use the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method to extract the most decisive depressive patterns by gender. Age, health, childhood conditions, and low education predict most depression risk later in life. In addition, we identify new predictive patterns in high-frequency emotion-enhancing life events and low utilization of dental care services.

**Quality of Government for Environmental Wellbeing?
Subnational Evidence from European Regions** (with Andrea Vaccaro). 2023. <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('environmental')">Abstract</a> ] </small>

<div id="environmental" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This study investigates the relationship between quality of government and
environmental wellbeing in 233 European regions at the NUTS-2 level. We find
that subnational environmental data is spatially interdependent and construct a set
of composite indicators of environmental wellbeing through Bayesian spatial factor
analysis. By using these composite indicators in linear regressions, we demonstrate
that institutional quality is a key determinant of environmental wellbeing. We also
find that the institutions-environment nexus varies across dimensions of
environmental wellbeing – institutions matter especially for air and soil quality.
Policymakers should be aware that environmental destruction can be tackled by
building more effective regional institutions.

**Spatial comprehensive Well-Being composite indicators: evidence from
Italian provinces** (with Chiara Gigliarano). 2023. <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('spatial')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][spatial-draft] ] </small>

<div id="spatial" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper proposes spatial comprehensive composite indicators to evaluate the wellbeing levels and ranking of Italian provinces with data from the Equitable and Sustainable Well-Being (BES) dashboard. We use a method based on Bayesian latent factor models, which allow us to include spatial dependence across Italian provinces, quantify uncertainty in the resulting estimates, and estimate data-driven weights for elementary indicators. The results reveal that the inclusion of spatial information changes the resulting composite indicator rankings compared to those produced by traditional composite indicators’ approaches. Estimated social and economic well-being is unequally distributed among southern and northern Italian provinces. In contrast, the environmental dimension appears less spatially clustered, and its composite indicators also reach above average levels in the southern provinces. The time series of well-being composite indicators of Italian macro-areas shows clustering and macro-areas discrimination on larger territorial units.

**The resilience of the Italian social protection system at the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak: territorial evidence** (with Francesco Figari, Carlo Fiorio, Luca Gandullia). 2020 <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('resilience')">Abstract</a> | [Link](https://www.rivisteweb.it/doi/10.1429/97786) ] </small>

<div id="resilience" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
The article provides a first quantification of the redistributive effects of automatic stabilizers and discretional policies imposed by the Italian government to limit the diffusion of COVID-19 in March 2020 and to compensate for income losses of individuals affected by the shutdown. In particular, we analyse the short term impact on family incomes, using the Italian module of EUROMOD which allow us to simulate the effects on incomes, poverty risks and inequality based on IT-SILC data combined with relevant information needed to identify the workers affected by the shutdown. The article provides timely evidence of the resilience of the Italian welfare state in the different geographical areas of the country facing an asymmetric shock, particularly strong from an economic perspective for some families and less for others even in the presence of compensative policies introduced by the government.
