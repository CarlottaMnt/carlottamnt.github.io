Hi, welcome to my home page! 

I am a doctoral researcher in Economics and Computational Social Sciences (Joint degree) at the [Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research](https://www.liser.lu/) (LISER) and part of the [DRIVEN](https://driven.uni.lu/) Doctoral Training Unit at the University of Luxembourg.

My interest lies at the intersection of applied microeconomics and machine learning, particularly topics in Public, Well-being, and Discrimination Economics. 

Before making my way to Luxembourg, I earned my Master's degree in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University in Milan.
