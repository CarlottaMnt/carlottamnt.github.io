Hi, welcome to my home page! 

I am a Research Associate at the [Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research](https://www.liser.lu/), working in the Department of [Living Conditions](https://www.liser.lu/living-conditions). 

I hold a joint PhD in Economics and Computational Social Sciences (Joint degree) from LISER and [Insubria University](https://www.uninsubria.it/), completed within the [DRIVEN](https://driven.uni.lu/) Doctoral Training Unit at the University of Luxembourg.

My work sits at the crossroads of **applied microeconomics** and **machine learning**, with a particular focus on labour economics and the economics of discrimination. Currently, I study how AI-driven hiring tools can shape diversity and discrimination in the labour market. In previous projects, I developed state-of-the-art generative transformer trained on Italian Social Security data to investigate socio-economic questions.

Feel free to get in touch if you’re exploring AI-driven approaches in the field of economics!
