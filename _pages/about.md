Hi, welcome to my home page! 

I am a doctoral researcher in Economics and Computational Social Sciences at the [Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research](https://www.liser.lu/) (LISER), and part of the [DRIVEN](https://driven.uni.lu/) Doctoral Training Unit. 

My passion lies in exploring the intersection of well-being, machine learning, discrimination, and labor economics.

Before making my way to Luxembourg, I earned my Master's degrees in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University in Milan.
